Dear readers,

   Here are the code and data set of Paper "Predicting Drug-disease Treatment Associations Based on Topological Similarity and Singular Value Decomposition".

   If you use the data set, please kindly cite this paper:

```
@inproceedings{wu2019TS-SVD,
  title={Predicting Drug-Disease Treatment Associations Based on Topological Similarity and Singular Value Decomposition},
  author={Wu, Guangsheng and Liu, Juan},
  booktitle={2019 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)},
  pages={153--158},
  year={2019},
  organization={IEEE}
}
```



   To run the code, Python 3 or Anaconda 3 is needed.  The results depend on the random numbers generated by your computer to some extent, which may not be exactly the same as those shown in the paper, maybe slightly different.

   If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact wgs@whu.edu.cn
